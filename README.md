# Hackthon-Push-Disease-Detection-Image

Disease detection model with image detection


#Reasons

**This is a basic app that uses efficiency net-0b.pth model for predictions and display the graph based output for image predictions 

**I am using the plant village dataset from kaggle.com which has about 15 classes which is a basic crop and also it will display the detection as multiple classes so its easy for the farmer to  understand the disease stats......
